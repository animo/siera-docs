# Installation

## MacOS

For MacOS, getting started with the Siera Desktop app is incredibly simple.&#x20;

Everything required to run the app is included, so you can simply download your specific version of the app from the [Siera Desktop](https://siera.animo.id/desktop) website and start using it right away.



## Linux

Installing and using the Siera Desktop app on Linux requires some additional work. The app doesn't include the libindy installation, which is required to run the app. Thankfully, the [Aries js documentation](https://aries.js.org/guides/getting-started/installation/nodejs/linux) provides a detailed guide on how to install libindy on Linux.&#x20;

Once you have installed libindy and downloaded the Linux version of the Siera Desktop app, you are ready to start exploring its features.
